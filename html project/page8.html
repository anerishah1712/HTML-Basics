<p><b><font color="black" size="4">Operations</b>
<br>In today’s globalized world, there are myriad opportunities for the rapid spread of diseases and other threats to health security. In the event of an emergency, public health emergency operation centres are a place for emergency management personnel to coordinate operational information and resources.
<br>
WHO’s Public Health Emergency Operations Centre Network (EOC-NET) promotes best practices and standards for emergency operation centres and builds Member States’ capacity to rapidly respond and detect to public health emergencies as mandated by the International Health Regulations.
<br>
WHO’s Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC) is the heart of this network. SHOC monitors global public health events around the clock and facilitates international collaboration during public health emergencies.
<br>
Following the detection of a potential major public health event, SHOC provides the communications platform to obtain further information from the affected country and other authoritative sources. Once that information is received, SHOC uses emergency management tools to support risk assessments and any required WHO response. Beyond response operations, SHOC is involved in identifying and tracking resources and appraising public health threats.
WHO uses an Incident Management System (IMS) to organize and manage each emergency response. Every individual working in emergencies for WHO (including non-WHO staff who deploy as part of the response team) must be familiar with the IMS structure and roles.

<p><b>Research in emergencies</b><br><br>
WHO brings the world’s scientists and global health professionals together to accelerate research and development in emergency situations. In order to prevent and respond to catastrophic events like pandemics, natural disasters and the emergence, or re-emergence, of highly pathogenic diseases, it is essential to be able to quickly gather and share the best available knowledge and evidence on diseases, and on potential available countermeasures.An important part of WHO's work with global expert networks is the Research and Development Blueprint (R&D Blueprint), a global strategy and preparedness plan that triggers the rapid activation of research and development activities during outbreaks. This includes fast-track development of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can save lives and prevent the spread of large-scale epidemics.

<p><b>Training for emergencies</b><br><br>
Today’s health emergencies are increasingly complex. We live in a globalized, urbanized and connected world where people, vectors and goods are constantly on the move. These movements amplify the threats to our health from infectious hazards, natural disasters, armed conflicts and other emergencies wherever they occur.Past crises have taught us that even the most qualified personnel require continued learning to respond safely and effectively to these 21st century threats. We need a ready, willing and able workforce – a workforce for excellence – that can be called upon to help save lives, reduce disease and suffering, and minimize socio-economic loss to affected communities and countries.That’s why the WHO Health Emergencies Programme is prioritizing learning and training as it works to meet WHO’s ambitious target of ensuring one billion people are better protected from health emergencies. In October 2018, the Programme established a new Learning and Capacity Development unit and launched its first-ever Learning Strategy to guide all training and learning activities across the country, regional and global levels.The Learning Strategy commits to creating a coherent, coordinated and high-quality approach and standards for learning to build WHO’s health emergency workforce and surge capacity supported by partners. It was developed by a 100-member task team and external consultants, with inputs from staff across the three levels of the Organization.

<p><b>Funding for emergencies</b><br><br>
WHO thanks all of the contributors that provide funding or in-kind contributions to support our work preventing and responding to emergencies.

WHO’s Global Health Emergency Appeal for 2022 helps ensure that 1 billion people will be better protected from health emergencies. This new annual appeal covers WHO’s requirements to meet urgent emergency and humanitarian health needs for every region, including the COVID-19 response. We need US$ 2.7 billion to serve people around the world in the most vulnerable settings, including ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Humanitarian Response Plans are based on rigorous assessment and analysis of need in identified countries. The plans include an overview of the situation, WHO’s objectives to address the health aspects of the crisis, and the funds that will be required to do so. They form part of the overall humanitarian response plans developed by partners in the wider humanitarian response.

The Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) allows WHO to respond rapidly to disease outbreaks and health emergencies--often in 24 hours or less. This saves lives and helps prevent unnecessary suffering. Furthermore, a quick response dramatically reduces the costs of controlling outbreaks and emergencies, as well as the wider social and economic impacts. The CFE is not earmarked, giving WHO the crucial flexibility, it needs to act quickly in response to disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and humanitarian emergencies.
