<br>The Global Health Histories project was established within the WHO headquarters in late 2004 and expanded into the regional offices from 2009 onwards. An official WHO activity, its mission is based on the principle that understanding the history of health, especially during the last 60 years, helps the global public health community to respond to the challenges of today and help shape a healthier future for everyone, especially those most in need.
<br>Forming an important part of the project, the Global Health Histories Seminars are organised with WHO partners around the world, at WHO headquarters, regional and country offices, as well as with WHO member states and university partners. Since 2005, the seminars have been generously supported by the Wellcome Trust.</p>
